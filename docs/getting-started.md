The Community Toolkit is designed to be a collection of integrations and extensions for .NET Aspire. There are two types of .NET Aspire integrations - "hosting" integrations in the app host, and "client" integrations in project code. Although integrations often come in pairs of both hosting and client packages, they don't have to, and a singular integration can stand alone without a counterpart of the other type. For more information on integrations in .NET Aspire, please follow the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/integrations-overview).

Each integration is a separate NuGet package that you can add to your project. All NuGet packages for the Community Toolkit are prefixed with `Aspire.CommunityToolkit`.
