# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is the purpose of this project?

The goal of the project is to be a centralised home for extensions and integrations for [Aspire](https://aka.ms/dotnet/aspire), helping to provide consistency in the way that integrations are built and maintained, as well as easier discoverability for users.

## How is this project different from the official Aspire project?

The Aspire Community Toolkit is a community-driven project that is maintained by the community and is not officially supported by the Aspire team. The toolkit is a collection of integrations and extensions that are built on top of the Aspire project.

## How can I contribute to the project?

Anyone can contribute to the Aspire Community Toolkit and before you get started, be sure to read the [Contributing Guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how to contribute to the project.

## Should I propose a new integration here on or the `dotnet/aspire` repo?

If you have an idea for a new integration, you should propose it here on the Aspire Community Toolkit repository, rather than [`dotnet/aspire`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire), as the official Aspire project is focused on the core functionality of the Aspire project.

If you have previously proposed an integration on the `dotnet/aspire` repository, you can still propose it here, but link to the existing issue on the `dotnet/aspire` repository to provide context.

## Finding Community Toolkit Integrations

Integrations from the Aspire Community Toolkit will appear in the "Add Aspire Integration" dialog in Visual Studio under the namespace `CommunityToolkit.Aspire.*`.
