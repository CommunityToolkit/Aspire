# .NET Aspire Community Toolkit Diagnostics

Some of the API's in the .NET Aspire Community Toolkit are decorated with the [`ExperimentalAttrible`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.codeanalysis.experimentalattribute). This attribute is used to indicate that an API is not ready for production use and is subject to change in the future.

## CTASPIRE001

There are cases where there is an API provided by the .NET Aspire Community Toolkit that is an intermidiary solution until a feature is added to .NET Aspire itself. This could be a private API that is not yet ready for public consumption, or a workaround waiting for the completion of a feature in .NET Aspire.

In these cases, refer to the `<remarks>` docs section of the API for more information on the feature in .NET Aspire and the issue(s) to track.

Once a release of .NET Aspire with that API is available, the API in the .NET Aspire Community Toolkit will be marked as obsolete and will be removed in a future release.
