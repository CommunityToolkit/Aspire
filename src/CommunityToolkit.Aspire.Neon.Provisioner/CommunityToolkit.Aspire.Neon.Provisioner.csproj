    <!-- The provisioner writes to a Docker named volume whose root directory
         is owned by root. .NET 8+ containers run as UID 1654 by default and
         cannot write there, so we run the provisioner as root. This is safe
         because the provisioner is a short-lived, one-shot process. -->
